# Backend Overview
This project implements a backend using Nest.js, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The backend is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, providing a solid foundation for the
application. Key features include:
- **Modular Architecture**: The backend is organized into modules, each representing a specific domain
- **RESTful API**: The backend exposes a RESTful API for communication with the frontend
- **Authentication and Authorization**: The backend implements JWT-based authentication and role-based access control
- **Database Integration**: The backend integrates with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- **Testing**: The backend includes unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability
- **Error Handling**: The backend implements a global error handling mechanism to provide consistent error responses
- **Logging**: The backend includes logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging
- **Configuration Management**: The backend uses environment variables and configuration files for managing settings
- **Deployment**: The backend is designed to be easily deployable to various environments (e.g., development, staging, production)
- **Documentation**: The backend API is documented using OpenAPI (Swagger) for easy reference
- **Security**: The backend implements security best practices, including input validation, output encoding, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)

# Testing Overview
This project implements a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality and reliability. The testing approach includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Each module and service is tested in isolation to verify its functionality.
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify the interaction between different modules and services.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Tests that simulate user interactions with the application to ensure the entire system works as expected.

## Testing Tools
- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework used for writing unit and integration tests.
- **Supertest**: A library for testing HTTP servers, used for integration tests.

For complex mocks and stubs, the project uses:
- **ts-mockito**: A TypeScript library for creating mocks and stubs in tests.
- **Sinon**: A library for creating spies, mocks, and stubs in JavaScript tests.

# Frontend Overview

This project implements a frontend using React with TypeScript, following Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) principles. The
frontend is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, providing a solid foundation for the application. Key
features include:
- **Modular Architecture**: The frontend is organized into features, each representing a specific domain or functionality.
- **State Management**: The frontend uses TanStack Query for data fetching and state management, ensuring efficient data handling.
- **Routing**: The frontend uses React Router for client-side routing, enabling a smooth user experience.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: The frontend implements JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
